# JetServer

`JetServer` is a lightweight, high-performance HTTP server implemented in C++98. Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, JetServer supports virtual hosting, customizable routing, CGI execution, and efficient connection handling using `poll()`. It aims to provide a solid foundation for learning server internals or building custom web services.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **HTTP/1.1 Support with Keep-Alive** ‚Äì Maintain persistent client connections for efficiency.
- **Event-Driven Architecture** ‚Äì Uses `poll()` for scalable, multiplexed I/O handling.
- **Chunked Response Sending** ‚Äì Prevents blocking when sending data to slow clients.
- **Isolated Client Request Handling** ‚Äì Each client has separate parsing and response generation.
- **CGI Script Support** ‚Äì Execute server-side scripts through configurable CGI programs.
- **Configurable CGI Extensions** ‚Äì Define which file extensions trigger CGI execution (e.g., `.php`).
- **Flexible Routing & Virtual Hosts** ‚Äì Support multiple servers, domains, and routes with custom behaviors.
- **Custom Error Pages & Redirections** ‚Äì Easily define error pages and HTTP redirects.
- **HTTP Method Filtering** ‚Äì Support for GET, POST, and DELETE with route-specific restrictions.
- **Autoindex Support** ‚Äì Enable directory browsing when no index file is found.
- **Request Body Size Limit** ‚Äì Enforce maximum allowed upload size (default 50MB).
- **Developer Mode Toggle** ‚Äì Enable or disable directory listing globally for development convenience.
- **Customizable Log File Path** ‚Äì Output logs to a specified file or stdout.
- **Request Logging** ‚Äì Captures key request details, including client IP, for auditing purposes.
- **Easy Configuration File** ‚Äì Simple syntax to configure servers, routes, CGI, and more.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **No HTTPS Support** ‚Äì Only HTTP is supported; no SSL/TLS encryption.
- **Limited HTTP Methods** ‚Äì Supports only GET, POST, and DELETE methods.
- **HTTP/1.1 Only** ‚Äì Does not support HTTP/2 or newer versions.
- **No Cookie Handling** ‚Äì Does not manage or process HTTP cookies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to install, build, and run `JetServer` on a Linux system.

- ### üì¶ Prerequisites

    Make sure the following packages are installed:

    - **Debian-based (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.)**:

        ```sh
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential
        ```
    - **Arch-based (Arch, Manjaro, etc.)**:

        ```sh
        sudo pacman -S base-devel
        ```

- ### ‚úÖ Installation

    - **Build Instructions**:

        - **1- Clone the Repository**:

            ```sh
            git clone https://github.com/oussamakami/jetserver
            cd jetserver
            ```

        - **2- Build the Project**:

            ```sh
            make jetserver
            ```

    - **Run the Web Server**:

        Once built, you can start the Web Server with:

        ```sh
        ./jetserver [config_file_path]
        ```
        > If no configuration file is provided, it defaults to `./jetserver.conf`.

- ### üê≥ Docker:

    If you prefer not to run `JetServer` directly on your machine, you can use Docker:

    - **Build and Run the Server**:

        ```sh
        make docker_run
        ```

        This will:
        - Build and run `jetserver` inside a Docker container.
        - Mount your local `www/` folder into the container.
        - Use the host network to expose the ports directly.
        - Write logs to `stdout`, which you can monitor with:

        ```sh
        docker logs -f jetserver
        ```

    - **Other Docker Commands**:

        - **Stop and remove the container**:

            ```sh
            make docker_kill
            ```

        - **Remove the Docker image**:

            ```sh
            make docker_rmi
            ```

        - **Build the Docker image**:

            ```sh
            make docker_build
            ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration File

JetServer is fully configurable using a structured configuration file. It supports **system-wide settings**, **server settings**, and **routes**. Blocks are defined as:

- `START_SYSTEM` ‚Ä¶ `END_SYSTEM`
- `START_SERVER` ‚Ä¶ `END_SERVER`
- `START_ROUTE` ‚Ä¶ `END_ROUTE` (must be inside a SERVER block)

**üí° Notes:**

- You can define multiple server blocks. Subsequent servers inherit `HOST` and `PORT` from the first server if not specified.
- Always save the configuration file after changes.
- Keep `DEVMODE` disabled in production for security.
